Neighborhood Map
================

Introduction
------------

A web application which lists down (just 5) places to visit in Mumbai. You can search (not that you will need it in 5 places) and find more about the place by clicking on the list item or the markers. It uses **Wikipedia API** to fetch the short description.

How to Open
-----------

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the directory in your terminal
3. Run the following commands

```bash
npm install
```
Open the `index.html` file. You need to have an internet connection for the application to run correctly.
